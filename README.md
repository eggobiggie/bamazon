# bamazon
Here is a gif and the basic flow for bamazon, stage 1:

* When the file is initally run, the customer is shown a list of all items available.

* The user chooses an item based on the product ID, and inputs how many they would like to purchase.

* If there is enough stock available, for the purposes of showing that the database is updating, they are shown stock before and after purchase, as well as the total cost of their purchase. 

* If there is not enough stock, the user is notified.

* After either a successful or unsuccessful transaction, the user is asked if they would like to purchase something else. If yes, the process begins again, if not, the process ends.
